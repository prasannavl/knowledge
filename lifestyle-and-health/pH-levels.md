- pH - Potentials of Hydrogen (hydrogen ion activity)
- Logarithmic scale: Two adjacent values differ by a factor of 10.
- pH of 3 is 10 times more acidic than pH of 4, and 100 times more than pH of 5.

## Health

- Normal blood pH: `7.35 to 7.45`
- CO<sub>2</sub> (slightly acidic) produced by cells as they use up oxygen.
- Regulated majorly by the lungs (fast), and supplemented by kidneys (slow).

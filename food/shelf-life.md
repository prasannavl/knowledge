# Shelf Life

All lifetimes are conservative approximations. Also account for scenarios such as temperature changes,
thawing and handling time to storage, all of which tend to have exponential adverse effects in most cases.

## Additional Notes

### General 

- Store fruits and vegetables separately due to the different gases they emit, which tend to
 accelerate spoiling each other.

### Apple

- Refrigerate in plastic container to keep dry.

#### Cut Apples

- Cut apples oxidize fast exposed to air.
- Oxidization can be slowed down by adding soaking in just a bit (or more) of pineapple, lemon, or orange juice.
- The citric acid (antioxidant) in the juices above help bring the pH down and slows the reaction. 
- Alternatively, even just water could help prevent exposure to air after cutting, and stays longer.
- Sharpness of knife also helps (due to smoother damage surface): [Comparison](https://scontent.fmaa1-3.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/11880438_894629077268956_3752425469564835899_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&_nc_oc=AQlhyxEVIixOY7F99Xe3f8Ymrc-fKbzm3LJ06YMTZt1GfX_XcRcmXPtj5IcQDnXGEC0&_nc_ht=scontent.fmaa1-3.fna&oh=92691e41235a7807a03a956dc7888bcc&oe=5DB5DC78)

**Long-term Storage:**

- Freshly cut, coated lemon juice (antioxidant; 1:6 parts of water), air-tight plastic wraps.
- Life: 3-4 days in fridge; 10-12 months in freezer, below 0F

## Citrus fruits: Lemon, Orange

- Refrigerate in plastic container to keep dry.
- Frozen citrus tend to become mushy due to high water content freezing and pressured
breakup of the fruit wall texture; not ideal for sliced raw consumption
- However frozen citrus works great for iced consumption or juicing.

## Garlic

- Never store in the fridge, but can be stored in the freezer, wrapped in foil or plastic wrap in a sealed container. Can last up to one year, but will lose flavor and change consistency.

## Tomato

- Never store unripe tomatoes in the fridge. They will never ripen.
- May be stored in the fridge once they're ripe for a short time, up-to 3 days.
